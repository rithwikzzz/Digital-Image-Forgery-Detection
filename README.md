# Digital-Image-Forgery-Detection
A comprehensive deep learning approach to detecting image manipulations using advanced CNN architectures and forensic feature learning. This project demonstrates state-of-the-art techniques in digital forensics and computer vision.
The Challenge
With the proliferation of sophisticated image editing tools and AI-generated content, detecting forged images has become increasingly critical. Traditional forensic methods struggle with modern manipulation techniques, necessitating advanced deep learning approaches.

This project addresses the growing threat of digital misinformation by developing robust detection systems capable of identifying various forgery types including splicing, copy-move, retouching, and GAN-based synthesis.

Our Solution
We employ advanced convolutional neural networks with attention mechanisms to learn forensic features directly from data. Our approach combines multiple detection strategies including noise residual analysis, edge inconsistency detection, and semantic understanding.

The system achieves high accuracy across multiple benchmark datasets while maintaining computational efficiency for practical deployment in real-world scenarios.


Why Does this Matter
In an era where "seeing is no longer believing," robust image forgery detection systems are essential infrastructure for maintaining trust in digital content. This project contributes to the broader effort of ensuring digital authenticity and combating misinformation.
